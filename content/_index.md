## Management Tools Immersion Day

In the past, organizations have had to choose between innovating faster and maintaining control over cost, compliance, and security. With AWS Management and Governance services, customers don’t have to choose between innovation and control—they can have both. 

With AWS, customers can enable, provision, and operate their environment for both business agility and governance control. AWS provides services for end-to-end IT lifecycle management, helping customers control and secure their environments, reduce costs, simplify compliance, and enhance operational efficiency.

The purpose of this Immersion day is to introduce customers to our set of management and governance services.
