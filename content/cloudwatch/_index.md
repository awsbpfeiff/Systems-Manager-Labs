### Introduction

There are two goals of monitoring: 
    - Achieve situational awareness to provide timely and effective responses and 
    - Gain insights for the business, development, and operations that enable proactive courses of action. 
 
In this workshop, we take you through the process of developing and implementing a workload monitoring strategy to achieve these objectives. You will learn how to: 
 
1. Build a monitoring plan 

2. Implement the plan using AWS Services: 
    - Configure telemetry sources using AWS Systems Manager Run Command and Parameter Store 
    - Collect telemetry using Amazon CloudWatch Logs 
    - Setup metrics and thresholds using Amazon CloudWatch Log-Filter Metrics 
    - Configure alarms to fire when metric thresholds are crossed using Amazon CloudWatch Alarms 
    - Setup notifications topics and subscriptions using Amazon Simple Notification Service 
    - Configure automated responses using AWS Lambda 
 
This lab will demonstrate how to alert on major categories of events, monitor for operational outcomes, trigger responses, and deliver insights.
