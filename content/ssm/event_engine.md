The AWS Event Engine was created to help AWS field teams run Workshops, GameDays, Bootcamps, Immersion Days, and other events that require hands-on access to AWS accounts.

Open a browser and navigate to the event engine login page: [https://dashboard.eventengine.run](https://dashboard.eventengine.run). You will be presented with terms and login page.  Please read and understand the terms governing use of event engine accounts.
