#### Prerequisites 

If you are running this workshop at an AWS event, please access your temporary AWS Account by connecting to the [AWS Workshop Portal](https://dashboard.eventengine.run/) and entering your participant hash. Otherwise, continue with the steps below.

1. To access the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/), log in to your AWS Account.

2. At the top right hand corner of your screen, select the **US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1** region to work in during this lab.

Be sure that you have Administrator IAM permissions to create resources in your AWS account. If you are using an account that has been provided for you by AWS, you will already have these permissions.

You will also be using AWS CLI commands during this lab.  Visit ([Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)) User Guide for assistance installing and configuring the AWS CLI.
