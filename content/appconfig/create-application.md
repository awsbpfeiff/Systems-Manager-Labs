#### Create an AppConfig Application

An application in AppConfig is a logical unit of code that provides capabilities for your customers. For example, an application can be a microservice that runs on Amazon EC2 instances, a mobile application installed by your users, a serverless application using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda, or any system you run on behalf of others.

1. Visit the [AppConfig](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/appconfig) Console and select **Create configuration data**

2. On the Create application page, Name the application **AppConfigLab** and provide an optional Description. ![](../images/appconfig-application.png)
