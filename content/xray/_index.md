### Introduction

AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture. 

X-Ray provides an end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your application, and shows a map of your applicationâ€™s underlying components. 

You can use X-Ray to analyze both applications in development and in production, from simple three-tier applications to complex microservices applications consisting of thousands of services.
