# AWS Systems Manager Workshop Introduction

This workshop is intended to provide a 200-300 level hands on experience with core AWS Systems Manager capabilities. Lets start with a brief overview of AWS Systems Manager capabilities: 

1.	**Resource Groups** - Group AWS resources together by any purpose or activity you choose, such as application, environment, region, project, campaign, business unit, or software lifecycle.
2.	**Documents** - Centrally define the configuration options and policies for your managed instances.
3.	**Run** - Run a command, with rate and error controls, that targets an entire fleet of managed instances. 
4.	**Session Manager** - Securely connect to a managed instance with a single click, without having to open an inbound port or manage SSH keys. 
5.	**Distributor** - Distributor lets you package your own software - or find AWS-provided software packages - to install on AWS Systems Manager managed instances.
6.	**State Manager** - Use and create runbook-style SSM documents that define the actions to perform on your managed instances.
7.	**Patch Manager** â€“ Simplify your operating system patching process for Windows and Linux.
8.	**Maintenance Window** - Automatically perform tasks in defined windows of time.
9.	**Compliance** - Quickly see which resources in your account are out of compliance and take corrective action from a centralized dashboard.
10.	**Parameter Store** - Separate your secrets and configuration data from your code by using parameters, with or without encryption, and then reference those parameters from a number of other AWS services.
11.	**Inventory** - Perform automated inventory by collecting metadata about your Amazon EC2 and on-premises managed instances. Metadata can include information about applications, network configurations, and more. 
12.	**Automation** - Automate or schedule a variety of maintenance and deployment tasks.
13.	**OpsCenter** - Centrally view, investigate, and resolve operational work items related to AWS resources.
14.	**Change Calendar** - Create calendar events to allow or block changes to your AWS resources
15.	**Explorer** - View consolidated inventory data from multiple AWS Regions and accounts that you manage. 
16.	**AppConfig** - Create, manage, and safely deploy application configuration data to your targets at runtime.
17.	**Hybrid Activations** - Create an activation to register on-premises servers and virtual machines (VMs), non-AWS Cloud servers, and other devices with AWS Systems Manager. Centrally manage Amazon EC2 instances and your hybrid environment from one location.
